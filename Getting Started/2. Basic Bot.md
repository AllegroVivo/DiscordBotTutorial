# Creating a Basic Bot Instance

Okay, let's finally jump into some code. We're not going to address any of the actual features of the bot right now, because, I want to start by getting an instance of our bot up and running, just to test out all the initial configuration we just did. So, in your IDE, let's create a new project (and virtual environment, if you're familiar with using VMs, otherwise you can ignore this) and name it whatever you like. Mine, of course, will be `FrogBot`. Once your IDE load the environment, take a look at the project directory pane, it should look *extremely* sparse - most likely only comprised of a folder for the virtual environment (which we can completely ignore from now on! Yay!) and an entry point script, commonly named `main.py`.
