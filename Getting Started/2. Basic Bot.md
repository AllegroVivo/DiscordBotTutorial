# Creating a Basic Bot Instance

## main.py and Imports

Okay, let's finally jump in. We're not going to address any of the unique features of the bot right now, because, I want to start by getting an instance of our bot up and running, just to test out all the initial configuration we just did. So let's start in the `main.py` file. If you don't have one, just create it in the top level directory of your project - the same place where we created the folders during setup. Erase any template text that might have been populated by your IDE, and we'll start with a few import statements. Notice that I'm significantly more explicit with my imports than you might be familiar with. When using typehinting, it's going to be cleaner in 9/10 cases to import and use the class itself directly as opposed to putting the module name beforehand. `discord.Bot()` -vs- `Bot()`.

```
import os

from discord    import Bot, Intents
from dotenv     import load_dotenv
```

These are the only dependencies for our main file for now, so let's wire them in!

## Instantiate Bot

Let's actually create the bot and connect. Add these lines under your imports.

```
bot = Bot(
    description="<Your Bot Description Here>",
    intents=Intents.default(),
    debug_guilds=[<Your Guild ID(s) Here>]
)
```

***(Click on hyperlinked class names throughout the tutorial to view the documentation!)***

The [Bot class](https://docs.pycord.dev/en/stable/api/clients.html#discord.Bot) constructor takes up to five arguments. In addition to what we're providing it, we could also declare `owner_id`/`owner_ids` and whether or not we want the bot to `auto_sync_commands`. We don't need to toy with those though. It should be fairly apparent that you need to provide your own description and guild information to the Bot constructor - don't just use my garbage placeholder text, that's not going to work. Note, `Intents.default()` should be the value passed for the `intents` parameter unless you're a bit more familiar with Intents and have an alternate plan. But if you're a bit newer to it, just use the default option.

Now, what does it mean with the parameter `debug_guilds`? What exactly does this do for us? Well, the `debug_guilds` parameter allows us to avoid registering any global commands for our bot with Discord. Why do we want to avoid that, though? An issue that occasionally arises during bot development is that global commands can take **up to 1 hour** to register with Discord. That's... pretty inefficient for our testing purposes, so by passing a list of guild IDs here, Discord will only create and update bot commands in the specified servers, this type of registration typically happens immediately.

## Environment File
So let's add the following lines at the very end of our file. But don't get too gung-ho, it won't run quite yet.

```
load_dotenv()

bot.run(os.getenv("DISCORD_TOKEN"))
```

What we're doing here is initializing our connection to a `.env` file - which we'll create in a moment - and then we're making a call to the bot's `run()` method to begin the event loop. If you've done any sort of application development outside of this, calling `bot.run()` would be equivalent to calling `app.exec()` for something like a GUI project.

So let's make that environment file, we need a place to store our secret variables. Create a new top-level file in your project directory named `.env` - just the file extension, no actual name. It should generally receieve a special icon from your IDE.

Within the `.env` file, we just need to drop in a single line:

```
DISCORD_TOKEN = "<Your Token Here>"
```

All we're doing here is declaring your secret bot token, which you should have copied during the setup step, and we're putting it somewhere that won't be publicly visible when uploading our code to a container or someplace like GitHub. Keeping your secret variables **actual secrets** is *vital* to devloping a bot. In fact, Discord has a sniffer that can detect when a bot token has been mistakenly exposed on GitHub and if it finds something, you'll get a DM from Discord's official account, Clyde, letting you know about it!

Once you've entered your token into the environment file, you can close that for now. We'll be back here later with more secrets! 

Now back in our `main.py` file, hopefully the bot's run call makes a little more sense now. What we're doing is, instead of declaring a variable for our token spearately, I've simply placed the call to `os.getenv()` inside the bot's `run()` call since that's quite literally the only place we'll need it. Additionally, it ensures that, because the token is being dropped directly into the bot, there's less likelihood of mistakes or user interference causing a crash.

## On Ready Event Listener

Now the last thing I'd like to add before we hit that big green GO button, is in between the bot definition and the call to `load_dotenv()` I want to add an event listener that prints out a message when the bot has booted fully and is ready to accept commands. This can easily be achieved by adding the following lines.

```
@bot.event("on_ready")
async def my_ready_function():

    print("FrogBot Online!")
````

There are a lot of potentially foreign concepts happening in these three lines of code, so let's examine them a bit.

`@bot.event` -- What does this do? An object preceded by the `@` sign is what's called a "decorator". Without delving too much into the concept, it's a way for the underlying library to take in a callable item (function/method) as an argument to an internal function. In this case, it's allowing us to specify one of *our* functions as a way to respond to an event behaviour. 

So, what event are we listening for? Well, what's great about the events system in Pycord, is that there are two separate, but equally-useful ways to specify the the decorator what event you are listening for. The first option is by using parentheses and passing the event name as a string_value into the actual decorator.

But, wait, that's not the approach I want to take. Our second, and more preferrable, option is to leave the parentheses off and actually name *our* function the name of the event we're expecting. So as you can see above, by simply naming the function itself `on_ready` we can eliminate the need for a seconary function name. That just looks cleaner and more direct to me, so we're going to go with the no-parentheses-name-the-function-what-it's-listening-for approach. Go ahead and change your code to look like this.

```
@bot.event
async def on_ready():

    print("FrogBot Online!")
```

## Testing & Review

Alright! Time for the dreaded testing step. However, this early in the process, it should hopefully be working like we anticipate. Go ahead and run the virtual machine inside your IDE, or fire up `main.py` PowerShell on your desktop, and you should be greeted with your defined on_ready message!.

***Great! So, in this portion of the tutorial, we accomplished:***

+ Setting up a bot instance
+ Creating our environment variable file
+ Printing a message to the console upon the bot's readiness to accept commands
+ Actually ran the bot! Yay!
