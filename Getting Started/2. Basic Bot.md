# Creating a Basic Bot Instance

## Project Setup

Okay, let's finally jump in. We're not going to address any of the actual features of the bot right now, because, I want to start by getting an instance of our bot up and running, just to test out all the initial configuration we just did. So, in your IDE, let's create a new project (and virtual environment, if you're familiar with using VMs, otherwise you can ignore this) and name it whatever you like. Mine, of course, will be `FrogBot`. Once your IDE load the environment, take a look at the project directory pane, it should look *extremely* sparse - most likely only comprised of a folder for the virtual environment (which we can completely ignore from now on! Yay!) and an entry point script, commonly named `main.py`. Let's add some directories for our project so we can stay organized from the get go. Go ahead and add the following folders (and subfolders) to your project directory.

+ assets
+ classes
  - core
  - profiles
+ cogs
+ resources
+ ui
+ utilites

We won't add things to all of these folders right this second, but I like having a general idea of how things will be organized when I start out. This minimizes the likelihood that we break a dependency by moving code and modules around between folders later on.
