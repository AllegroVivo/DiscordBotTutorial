# Creating and Storing Custom Guild Data Object

## `GuildData` Class

Okay, so we have a super basic bot up and running. But, it's pretty boring right now - it doesn't really ***do*** anything. But before we get started on features, we need to do a little more backend setup. Since our end-goal is to potentially have this bot running in multiple servers, serving a variety of users, we need to create a framework that will allow our bot to function in, and hold data pertaining to, multiple guilds at once. Scalability is key when building a Discord bot, so throughout the tutorial, we're going to be functioning under the assumption that our end goal is for this bot to be placed in as many servers a possible. This will introduce a variety of roadbloacks, but we'll work through all of them in time.
