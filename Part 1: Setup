# Part 1 - Setup

## Introduction

During my time learning Python, I was primarily interested in Discord bots, however, I found that once I reached a certain point, all the tutorials out there were too basic or covered the same things as a multitude of other tutorials. I’ve felt like there’s a general lack of creativity for bot tutorials, so I hope to break that mold with this step-by-step guide. We’re going to make the most of the Discord platform and use it to create a desktop-style application!
