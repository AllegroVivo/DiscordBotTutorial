# Part 1 - Setup & Preparation

## Introduction

During my time learning Python, I was primarily interested in Discord bots, however, I found that once I reached a certain point, all the tutorials out there were too basic or covered the same things as a multitude of other tutorials. I’ve felt like there’s a general lack of creativity for bot tutorials, so I hope to break that mold with this step-by-step guide. We’re going to make the most of the Discord platform and use it to create a desktop-style application!

***By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:***

+ Set up and configure a new bot account with Discord.
+	Create slash commands to accomplish various functions for the user.
+	Understand the various Discord events and methods of handling those.
+	Use Discord UI elements to create an interface with the bot.
+	And lots more things I can’t even think of right now!

For the tutorial, I’ll be demonstrating a bot that I came up with during the pandemic, when I was immersed in the RP community of Final Fantasy XIV. I managed an in-game venue, more or less a digital version of a real business. And while I was there, I wrote this bot to perform various administrative functions for me – to keep me sane. Profile creation, raffle management, a time clock, and many more functions are waiting to be developed. The first feature we’ll look at is the ability to make customizable embedded profiles for users!

Do note, this tutorial is going to be written for an intermediate-level audience, but hopefully accessible to newer developers as well. We’re going to look at object-oriented programming practices, how to keep code concise and clean, module structure, and more. There may be some times when you need to take a break and look up another tutorial – written or video – that explains a concept I’m discussing in more detail. Hopefully that won’t be the case, as I’ll try to explain everything as simply and thoroughly as possible, so, let’s get started!

One final comment. You’ll notice I use frogs as a recurring theme throughout the tutorial. I find that giving a bot some personality and a theme not only makes the user feel more comfortable, but honestly, it makes the development process a lot more fun and individualistic. Feel free to use your favorite animal!

## Discord Bot Account Setup

Before we jump into things, there are a handful of setup tasks that we should take a look at. None of them are too difficult or time consuming, but they’re necessary to get up and running. First, we’ll take a look at the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discordapp.com/developers/applications) and create ourselves a bot account. After visiting the link I just provided, ensure you’re on the “My Applications” page, and click the “New Application” button in the top right.
