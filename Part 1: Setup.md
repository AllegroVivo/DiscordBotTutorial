# Part 1 - Setup

## Introduction

During my time learning Python, I was primarily interested in Discord bots, however, I found that once I reached a certain point, all the tutorials out there were too basic or covered the same things as a multitude of other tutorials. I’ve felt like there’s a general lack of creativity for bot tutorials, so I hope to break that mold with this step-by-step guide. We’re going to make the most of the Discord platform and use it to create a desktop-style application!

***By the end of this tutorial, you should be able to:***

•	Set up and configure a new bot account with Discord.
•	Create slash commands to accomplish various functions for the user.
•	Understand the various Discord events and methods of handling those.
•	Use Discord UI elements to create an interface with the bot.
•	And lots more things I can’t even think of right now!
